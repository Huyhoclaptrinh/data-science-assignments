# Assignment 1: Real-World Applications of Supervised and Unsupervised Learning

## Description
This project involves providing real-world examples for both supervised and unsupervised machine learning. The goal is to clearly differentiate between labeled and unlabeled data scenarios, and explain practical applications for each category.

The assignment focuses on conceptual understanding rather than implementation, helping to build foundational intuition about where and why machine learning techniques are applied.

## Project Structure

- **assignment1.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook containing detailed explanations and examples of supervised and unsupervised learning tasks.
- **assignment1.html**: Rendered HTML version for easier viewing.

## Key Topics Covered

- **Supervised Learning Examples**:
  - Regression tasks (e.g., employee performance prediction, soccer league estimation)
  - Classification tasks (e.g., animal recognition from labeled images)

- **Unsupervised Learning Examples**:
  - Clustering (e.g., music genre detection based on audio features)
  - Recommendation systems based on user behavior without labeled preferences

## Concepts Demonstrated

- Difference between labeled and unlabeled data
- Appropriate real-world scenarios for applying regression, classification, and clustering
- Understanding the underlying structure of data-driven predictions and groupings

## Requirements

You only need a Jupyter environment to view the explanations. No coding dependencies are required.

## Instructions

1. Open `assignment1.ipynb` with Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
2. Read through the explanations and examples.
3. Optionally, extend the document by adding more real-world cases or visual examples.
