## Assignment 8: Analyzing College Data

### Description
This project involves analyzing a dataset of college statistics. The analysis is conducted using a Jupyter Notebook (`assignment8.ipynb`) and an HTML file (`assignment8.html`) for visualizing the results. The dataset, `collegeData.csv`, contains key metrics for various colleges, such as costs, admissions rates, and graduation rates.

### Project Files
1. **`assignment8.ipynb`**: 
   - A Python-based Jupyter Notebook for processing and analyzing the `collegeData.csv` dataset.
   - Includes data loading, cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis.
   - Outputs include plots and data insights about college trends.

2. **`assignment8.html`**:
   - A rendered HTML file that showcases the output of the analysis.
   - Useful for viewing the results without requiring a Jupyter environment.

3. **`collegeData.csv`**:
   - The dataset containing information about various colleges.
   - Used as the input for the analysis.

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.8+**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- Python Libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`

### Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository to your local system.
2. Install the required Python libraries using:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook assignment8.ipynb
   ```
4. Run the notebook cells sequentially to perform the analysis.

### Usage
- Modify the `collegeData.csv` file to include updated college statistics if necessary.
- Use the notebook to analyze trends or modify it to explore other questions.
- View the `assignment8.html` file in a browser to review the analysis.

### Results Overview
The project analyzes trends in college admissions, costs, and other metrics, providing insights such as:
- Relationships between tuition costs and graduation rates.
- Differences in private versus public colleges.

### Contribution
Feel free to submit pull requests or raise issues to improve the analysis or add new features.
