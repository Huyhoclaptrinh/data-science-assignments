# Assignment 5: Healthcare Data Analysis with K-Nearest Neighbors

## Description
This project applies K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification to healthcare data to predict patient risk categories based on clinical features.  
It focuses on data preprocessing, manual 10-fold cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning for \(k\) values, and model evaluation based on accuracy and mean squared error.

## Project Files

- **assignment5.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing full preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation pipeline.
- **assignment5.html**: Rendered HTML output of the notebook.
- **healthcareTrain.csv**: Training dataset.
- **healthcareTest.csv**: Test dataset.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python Libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - scikit-learn

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository locally.
2. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook assignment5.ipynb
   ```
4. Execute notebook cells sequentially to replicate the analysis.

## Usage
- Update CSV files as needed with new or additional data.
- Utilize the provided notebook to extend analyses or conduct further explorations.
- View the `assignment5.html` file in a web browser for interactive exploration.

## Results Overview
Key insights derived from healthcare data include:
- Performance evaluation of predictive models.
