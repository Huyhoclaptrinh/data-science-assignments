# Assignment 5: Healthcare Data Analysis

## Description
This project involves analyzing healthcare data to perform predictive modeling and statistical analysis. It includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, data preprocessing, and predictive modeling using Python. The analysis is performed within a Jupyter Notebook (`assignment5.ipynb`) and rendered interactively in HTML format (`assignment5.html`).

## Project Files

- **assignment5.ipynb:**
  - Jupyter Notebook containing Python scripts for the analysis.
  - Includes data preprocessing, statistical modeling, and visualizations.

- **assignment5.html:**
  - HTML output of the notebook for interactive visualization of results.

- **healthcareTrain.csv:**
  - Training dataset containing healthcare-related metrics used for model training.

- **healthcareTest.csv:**
  - Test dataset used for evaluating the performance of predictive models.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python Libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - scikit-learn

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository locally.
2. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook assignment5.ipynb
   ```
4. Execute notebook cells sequentially to replicate the analysis.

## Usage
- Update CSV files as needed with new or additional data.
- Utilize the provided notebook to extend analyses or conduct further explorations.
- View the `assignment5.html` file in a web browser for interactive exploration.

## Results Overview
Key insights derived from healthcare data include:
- Performance evaluation of predictive models.
- Identification of important features influencing healthcare outcomes.
- Visual analysis and statistical interpretation of healthcare trends.
