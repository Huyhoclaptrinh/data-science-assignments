# Assignment 3: Analyzing k-Means, QB Performance, and RBF Classification Data

## Description
This project involves analyzing datasets related to clustering (k-Means), multiple linear regression (MLR) for quarterback (QB) performance, and Radial Basis Function (RBF) classification. Analysis and visualizations are conducted using Python within a Jupyter Notebook (`assignment3.ipynb`) and displayed via an HTML file (`assignment3.html`).

## Project Files

- **assignment3.ipynb:**
  - Jupyter Notebook containing Python code for data analysis.
  - Includes data loading, exploratory analysis, statistical modeling, and visualization.
  - Provides plots, statistical evaluations, and actionable insights.

- **assignment3.html:**
  - HTML file rendered from the Jupyter Notebook.
  - Allows viewing the results interactively without needing Jupyter.

- **kMeansData.csv:**
  - Dataset utilized for clustering analysis with the k-Means algorithm.
  - Enables the exploration of natural groupings in data.

- **QB2022_MLR.csv:**
  - Dataset used for multiple linear regression analysis.
  - Contains quarterback performance metrics for predictive modeling.

- **QB2022_MLR_test.csv:**
  - Test dataset for evaluating the predictive model's accuracy.
  - Helps verify model effectiveness.

- **rbfClassification.csv:**
  - Dataset employed in Radial Basis Function (RBF) classification.
  - Useful for examining the application of RBF networks to classification problems.
