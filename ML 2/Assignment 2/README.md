# Assignment 2: Analyzing Healthcare and O-Ring Data

## Description
This project involves the analysis of healthcare and O-Ring datasets using Python. The primary goal is to apply data processing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and statistical modeling techniques to extract meaningful insights. The analysis is conducted using a Jupyter Notebook (`assignment2.ipynb`) and the corresponding HTML output (`assignment2.html`) for easy visualization of results.

## Project Files

- **assignment2.ipynb:**
  - Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code used for data analysis.
  - Includes data loading, cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis.
  - Outputs include plots, statistical test results, and insights.

- **assignment2.html:**
  - Rendered HTML version of the Jupyter Notebook.
  - Provides an interactive view of the analysis without needing a Python environment.

- **healthcareTrain.csv:**
  - Training dataset containing healthcare-related data.
  - Includes patient metrics used to train models.

- **healthcareTest.csv:**
  - Test dataset containing healthcare data.
  - Used to validate and assess the model's performance.

- **ORing.csv:**
  - Dataset related to the O-Ring used in aerospace applications.
  - Contains metrics that help explore factors influencing O-Ring performance.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python Libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - scikit-learn

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository to your local system.
2. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook assignment2.ipynb
   ```
4. Execute the notebook cells sequentially to replicate the analysis.

## Usage
- Modify the CSV files to include updated data if necessary.
- Use the provided notebook for further exploratory analysis or adapt it to address additional research questions.
- Review the HTML file (`assignment2.html`) in a web browser for a comprehensive visual overview.

## Results Overview
The analysis provides key insights such as:
- Relationships among healthcare metrics and patient outcomes.
- Predictive modeling performance on healthcare data.
- Influencing factors for O-Ring performance and reliability.

## Contribution
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to submit pull requests or raise issues to enhance the analysis or introduce additional functionalities.
