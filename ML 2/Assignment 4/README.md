# Assignment 4: Bias-Variance Tradeoff Analysis

## Description
This project analyzes the bias-variance tradeoff by comparing two simple learning models — a constant predictor and a linear predictor — when trying to approximate a nonlinear target function \( f(x) = \sin(\pi x) \).  
The analysis explores how model complexity impacts bias, variance, and overall expected error.

The analysis is performed using Python within a Jupyter Notebook (`assignment4.ipynb`) and rendered as an HTML file (`assignment4.html`) for easy visualization.

## Project Files

- **assignment4.ipynb**:
  - Jupyter Notebook containing Python code to simulate experiments, compute bias, variance, and visualize results.
  
- **assignment4.html**:
  - Rendered HTML file generated from the notebook.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python Libraries:
  - numpy
  - matplotlib

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository locally.
2. Install necessary Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
