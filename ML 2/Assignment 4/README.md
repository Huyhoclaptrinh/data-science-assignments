# Assignment 4: Data Analysis and Visualization

## Description
This project involves comprehensive data analysis and visualization. The analysis is performed using Python within a Jupyter Notebook (`assignment4.ipynb`) and rendered in an interactive HTML format (`assignment4.html`).

## Project Files

- **assignment4.ipynb:**
  - Jupyter Notebook containing Python scripts for data analysis.
  - Data processing, statistical analysis, and visualization.

- **assignment4.html:**
  - HTML file generated from the notebook.
  - Allows interactive viewing of results.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python Libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository locally.
2. Install necessary Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook assignment4.ipynb
   ```
4. Run notebook cells sequentially to replicate the analysis.

## Usage
- Adapt notebook scripts for custom analyses or further exploration.
- View `assignment4.html` in a web browser to interactively explore visualizations and analysis results.

## Results Overview
The notebook provides visual and statistical insights derived from data analysis, aiding in effective data-driven decision-making.

## Contribution
